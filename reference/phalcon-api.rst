Phalcon API
-----------
We, the creators of Phalcon, are mainly PHP programmers, we are lazy and do not want to deal 100% of the time with low-level details like segmentation faults or memory leaks. We believe that PHP language is incredible, and Phalcon is a contribution to all those things we do every day and it could be faster.

Moreover we want a fast and stable framework. For this reason we have created the Phalcon API. The use of this API helps us to write C code in a PHP style. We have developed a number of functions to help the programmer to write code more interoperable with PHP in a easier way.

Phalcon API is based on the Zend API, but we have added more features to facilitate us the work. Phalcon is a very large project, frameworks need to be developed and improved every day, Phalcon API helps us to write C code that is more stable and familiar to PHP developers.

If you're a PHP developer maybe you don't know C or you don't want to learn C, but after read this guide you will find the Phalcon API very familiar to your knowledge.
